Small REST api made in java using spring boot.  
It's made as a project for a java class at uni and also to learn how a REST api functions.

# Run instruction:
If you use maven just open the project and run it using the the command "mvn spring-boot:run".  
The api runs on the 3001 port, but you can change that in the application.properties file which you can find under resources.
