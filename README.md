# General info:
Small REST api made in java using spring boot.  
It's made as a project for a java class at uni and also to learn how a REST api functions.  
In the **databaseExample.txt** file you can find commands to create the postgreSQL database on your computer to test out the api.

# Run instruction:                                                                                                         
Add the **url**, **username** and **password** for the database in the **application.properties** file.  
Run it using **"mvn spring-boot:run"** command.  
The api runs on the **3001 port**, but you can change that in the **application.properties** file which you can find under resources.
